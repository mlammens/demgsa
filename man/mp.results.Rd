\arguments{
\item{spatial}{TRUE/FALSE - should spatial parameters be extracted from the *.mp file,
including factors such as dispersal, correlation, and factors included in
*.ptc files, if included}

\item{ptc}{TRUE/FALSE - Is a *.ptc file included?  If yes, some spatial information can
be extracted from this file}

\item{ptcFiles}{A single path to a ptc file or a vector of ptc files with which to extract
data from.}

\item{ptcFileIter}{For each ptcFile, the corresponding iteration as noted in the HabDyn
history file.  If no history file is used, iter values can be some user defined
values, however an error will be generated if the length of ptcfiles and
ptcFileIter do not match.}

\item{habdyn}{TRUE/FALSE - Was HabDyn module used? Is there a corresponding HabDyn
history file?}

\item{hdhFile}{The full path name to the HabDyn history (.txt) file}

\item{verbose}{Print function progress and checkpoints.}

\item{mpList}{The full list object of an MP file that has been run (i.e., has results)}

\description{
\code{mp.results} Calculates various endpoints from the results of an MP
simulation as carried out in RAMAS. Use for Metapop version 5 and 5.1
file formats. Based on ResOut.exe program written by R. Akcakaya
}
\details{
The resulting data.frame includes several parameters and endpoints. Each
is discribed below.
\itemize{
 \item mpFile Name of the MP file the data for a particular row are
 associated with
 \item metapop.initab Initial population abundance for metapopulation
 \item EigenVal Growth rate based on Stage (Age) Matrix (i.e., Eigen value
 of this matrix)
 \item GenTime Generation time, as calculated using \code{\link{generation.time}}
 from the \code{popbio} package

 \item Rmax Population level maximum growth rate, use if density dependence
 is contest or scramble type.

 depending on density dependence model

 \item N.CV.10 CV of N (calculated as (N(+1S.D) - N(-1S.D.)/(2*Navg), from
 Average Abundance for time step 10)
 \item St.First.Rep Stage level of first reproduction
 \item St.First.Rep.Name Name of stage level of first reproduction
 \item ext.risk Exinction risk = (# reps resulting in extinction) / (total # of reps)
 \item threshold The quasi-extinction threshold. Value set in Stochasticity
 section of MP Module.
 \item prob.thresh.maxt Risk of falling below the Threshold at least once
 by the final time step.
 Calculated using information regarding the time of first crossing of the extinction
 \item med.time.cross Median time to fall below the quasi-extinction threshold
 \item prob.50 Prob(50): Risk of falling below a population size of 50
 individuals at least once by the final

 individuals at least once by the final
 \item prob.1000 Prob(1000): Risk of falling below a population size of 1000
 individuals at least once by the final

 the intial metapop size at least once
